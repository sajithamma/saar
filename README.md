# Software As A Response (SAAR)

React, Flutter etc. introduced component architecture. These are self-contained containers that can present something and take action. This gave HTML elements a kind of superpower. They could now work independently for a feature, while still managing communication and state across components.

Now imagine, instead of these components being part of a big website, they are delivered as responses from an LLM chat. Like, you ask ChatGPT about tax and it gives you a working financial calculator, not just a message.

Thatâ€™s where the world is going.

This is the new UI of AI.

This project demonstrates the implementation of custom components in Chainlit with various interactive features including callbacks, actions, and dynamic updates.

## Demo

## Features

- Custom React components integration with Chainlit
- Interactive button components with callbacks
- Dynamic element updates
- Action handling
- User message sending
- Element deletion capabilities

## Component Example

The project includes a sample component (`HelloWorld.jsx`) that demonstrates:

- Button click handling
- Action dispatching
- Dynamic text updates
- User message sending
- Element property updates

```jsx
// Example usage
<Button onClick={() => handleClick('I too')}>{button_text}</Button>
```

## Available Actions

The component demonstrates several Chainlit actions:

1. `callAction`: Triggers custom actions with payload
2. `sendUserMessage`: Sends messages to the chat
3. `updateElement`: Updates component properties dynamically
4. `deleteElement`: Removes the component from the UI

## API Reference

### updateElement
```typescript
updateElement: (nextProps: Record<string, any>) => Promise<{success: boolean}>;
```

### callAction
```typescript
callAction: (action: { name: string, payload: any }) => void;
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Setup a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   chainlit run ui.py
   ```
